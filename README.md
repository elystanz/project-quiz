# Studio Ghibli & Dogs!

## Description
This quiz application presents users with a variety of questions to assess their compatibility with characters from iconic Studio Ghibli films, and pair those results with a dog that is most like your character. The quiz is meant to be fun, relatively pointless, and very educational on the coding end!

Thank you to the hosts of the API for making this quiz possible!

## Support
Please reach out with issues if you notice any bugs or have any suggestions when taking the quiz. Any and all feedback is appreciated!

## Roadmap
As we develop this application, more questions will be added to allow a more precise and accurate result for the user. As well, the localStorage persistence during page refresh will be optimized to save current data and not restart the quiz until the "Restart Quiz!" button is clicked at the end of the game.
